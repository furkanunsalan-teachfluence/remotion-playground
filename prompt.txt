Transitions (12 frames each at 30fps = 0.4s)

Use TransitionSeries from @remotion/transitions for scene management.
Use linearTiming({ durationInFrames: 12 }) for all transitions.

- Scene 1→2: fade() from @remotion/transitions/fade
- Scene 2→3: slide({ direction: 'from-right' }) from @remotion/transitions/slide
- Scene 3→4: fade()
- Scene 4→5: fade()
- Scene 5→6: slide({ direction: 'from-right' })
- Scene 6→7: slide({ direction: 'from-bottom' })
- Scene 7→8: fade()

Total duration calculation:
Scene durations in frames (at 30fps): 135 + 90 + 135 + 135 + 120 + 120 + 135 + 120 = 990
Minus 7 transitions × 12 frames = 84
Effective total: 906 frames = 30.2s ≈ 30s

Remotion Technical Requirements

Animation Rules:
- ALL animations MUST be driven by useCurrentFrame() hook
- CSS transitions and CSS animations are FORBIDDEN
- Tailwind animation class names are FORBIDDEN
- Use spring() from remotion for bouncy/natural motion (returns 0 to 1)
- Use interpolate() from remotion for mapping frame ranges to values
- Use Easing.inOut(Easing.cubic) for smooth scroll animations
- Use Math.sin()/Math.cos() with frame for floating/pulsing animations
- Use staggered spring delays for sequential element appearances

Image Rules:
- MUST use <Img> component from remotion (NOT native <img> or CSS background-image)
- Use staticFile() to reference images in the public/ folder
- Example: <Img src={staticFile("images/logo-full.png")} />

Font Loading:
- Use @remotion/google-fonts/Inter for font loading
- Load weights: 400, 600, 700, 800
- Example:
  import { loadFont } from "@remotion/google-fonts/Inter";
  const { fontFamily } = loadFont("normal", {
    weights: ["400", "600", "700", "800"],
    subsets: ["latin"],
  });

Scene Management:
- Use TransitionSeries from @remotion/transitions
- Each scene is a TransitionSeries.Sequence with durationInFrames
- Transitions use TransitionSeries.Transition with presentation and timing props
- Install @remotion/transitions if not present

Icon Components:
- All icons must be custom SVG components (no emojis, no icon libraries)
- Keep SVGs simple and clean, matching the Primary color
- Icons needed: graduation-cap, layout, mail, bar-chart, star, check

Key Reusable Components:
- BrowserFrame: macOS-style browser chrome with traffic lights + URL bar
- FeatureCard: icon + title + description card with spring entrance
- StatBadge: floating pill with stat text
- Scene wrapper components for consistent padding/layout
